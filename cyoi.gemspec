A library to ask an end-user to choose an infrastructure (AWS, OpenStack, etc), region, and login credentials.

This library was extracted from [inception-server](https://github.com/drnic/inception-server) for reuse by [bosh-bootstrap](https://github.com/StarkAndWayne/bosh-bootstrap). It might also be useful to your own CLI applications that need to ask a user to give you their infrastructure credentials/region so your application can control their infrastructure (say via [fog](http://fog.io)).
